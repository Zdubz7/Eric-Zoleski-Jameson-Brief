              <p>“Sine Metu”. Jameson has been producing their carefully triple distilled whiskey 
                “without fear” for over 200 years. During this time, Jameson has found shelf space 
                across all bars around the world through two world wars and even American prohibition. 
                Yet in France, there is a desire to relaunch “Without Fear” campaign for 
                a new generation of whiskey drinkers. </p>

              <p>Jameson, a proud and established whiskey brand that has 
                served millions “without fear” for more than 200 years has been 
                losing strength among millennials in France; a country that drinks 
                the most whiskey per capita (2.15 liters, per person). Moving towards 
                craft spirits that are locally distilled, French millennials seem to 
                not be affected by Jameson’s messaging anymore. Despite using their 
                land in the south of France to grow maize for Jameson whiskey, they 
                weren’t as invested in us as we were with them. </p>

              <p>Reconnect with French millennials in order to reinvigorate 
                Jameson’s “without fear” motto that is known throughout the world. 
                Making it a brand that they can stand with as they live their lives 
                “without fear” as well. </p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Insight</h2>
        <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">Millennials aren’t afraid to challenge the status quo.<br>
          Their desire for a world that is more inclusive is evident in demonstrations of mass <br>
          protests and strikes, especially in France. A carefully conducted national study among <br>
          French millennials ranging in age from 22-35 revealed that 37% of their purchasing behavior <br>
          is heavily tied with social causes. </p>

      <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">A majority of millennial respondents further explained that<br>
        they gravitated towards causes that spoke to their sense of community and personal duty. <br>
        When asked which social cause is most important to you, 48% expressed their concern for climate change.<br>
        This global concern is a heavy burden that weighs on their minds. An issue that has serious ramifications  <br>
        that will not only impact them but the generation after them is forcing this young demographic to change  <br>
        their attitudes and daily routines.  </p>

          <h2 class="mb-6">The Strategy</h2>
          <p class="font-weight-light mb-2"><strong>"Establish Jameson as a ‘purpose-driven’ brand in France amongst millennials.”</strong></p>
              <br>
          <p class="font-weight-light mb-1">In December of 2015, world leader’s gathered in Paris and reached <br> 
            a landmark agreement to combat climate change and accelerate actions needed <br>
            for a sustainable low carbon future. Two years later, the decision made by the U.S. <br>
            to withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement created a surge of sociopolitical uncertainty <br>
            throughout the world. Mass protests spilled into the Paris streets, thousands of young protesters <br>
            voicing their frustrations.  Unite behind the specific social cause that French millennials are <br>
            most concerned with, climate change to offer the vision of hope, to continue to live “without fear”. <br>
            Push forward for progress and Jameson will be there with you every step of the way. Make Jameson whiskey <br>
            synonymous with fearless activism and helped French millennials see <br>
            themselves as the fierce forces of change that they are. </p>
