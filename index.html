              <p>“Sine Metu”. Jameson has been producing their carefully triple distilled whiskey 
                “Without Fear” for over 200 years. During this time, Jameson has found shelf space 
                across all bars around the world through two world wars and even American prohibition. 
                <br>Yet in France, there is a desire to relaunch “Without Fear”<br> campaign for 
                a new generation of whiskey drinkers. </p>

              <hr>
              <p>Jameson, a proud and established whiskey brand that has 
                served millions “Without Fear” for more than 200 years has been 
                losing strength among millennials in France; a country that drinks 
                the most whiskey per capita (2.15 liters, per person). Moving towards 
                craft spirits that are locally distilled, French millennials seem to 
                not be affected by Jameson’s messaging anymore. Despite using their 
                land in the south of France to grow maize for Jameson whiskey, they 
                weren’t as invested in us as we were with them. </p>

          <h2 class="mb-6">The Strategy</h2>
          <p class="font-weight-light mb-2"><strong>"Establish Jameson as a ‘purpose-driven’ brand in France<br>amongst millennials.”</strong></p>
              <br>
          <p class="font-weight-light mb-1">In December of 2015, world leader’s gathered in Paris and reached <br> 
            a landmark agreement to combat climate change and accelerate actions<br>
            needed for a sustainable low carbon future. Two years later, the decision<br>
            made by the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement created a surge<br>
            of sociopolitical uncertainty throughout the world. Mass protests spilled into<br>
            the Paris streets, thousands of young protesters voicing their frustrations. </p>
          <br>
            <p class="font-weight-light mb-1">Unite behind the specific social cause that French millennials are most concerned with,<br>
             climate change to offer the vision of hope, to continue to live “without fear”. Push forward<br>
             for progress and Jameson will be there with you every step of the way. Make Jameson whiskey <br>
            synonymous with fearless activism and helped French millennials see themselves <br>
            as the fierce forces of change that they are. </p>

        is an opportunity to establish ourselves as a brand that not only stands for<br>

        capture our shared interests with French millennials that despite this setback,<br>

        <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">We turned to media to maximize our impact. A day after the US <br>
          decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, we debuted our <br>
          “Live Without Fear” film. The film highlights France’s consistent fearless<br>
          spirit by showing young French protesters fighting in the French Revolution<br>
          celebrating their victory with a bottle of Jameson. Later fast-forwarding to the <br>
          modern days of the French millennials coming back from the climate change protests<br>
          and unwinding with a bottle of Jameson bottle as well. Jameson, from France’s<br>
          early revolutionary days to its current fight for sensible climate change reforms,<br>
          has always been in support for French progress.  </p>
